09/24/2013 - monachus - It's now running an SSH server mapped to port 2222 on the 
docker host.  Push/pull/keys over SSH with gitlab-shell all seem to work.
09/23/2013 - monachus - Postfix is running now as a daemon, launched out of `/start`.
I couldn't (quickly) find a nice way to put it under supervisor, so if you 
have any thoughts, let me know at github.
